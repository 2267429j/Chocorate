# Chocorate
Repo for our second year WAD project that aims to setup the chocorate website (about rating chocolate) using django

TODO (incomplete list)
add gitignore for db.sqlite3
make nice html for all views
	make signin/up forms
make nice base html
create database/migrate/test
make admin look nice?

Consider merging addPost and myPost

CSS/HTML base
- figure out how to make links show diff color when on relevant page
- if possible, get line under header to extend whole width of page
