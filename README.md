# Chocorate
Repo for our second year WAD project that aims to setup the Chocorate website (about rating chocolate) using django

TODO (incomplete list)
- make nice html/css for all views
	make signin/up forms
- make nice base html
- create database/migrate/test
- make search logic
- add specifics under 'marks' that we're being marked on in here

CONSIDER
- merging addPost and myPost
- Bootstrap
- making admin look nice

CSS/HTML base
- if possible, get line under header to extend whole width of page
- add username OR sign in/up
- add sign out
- add search box


MARKS
- get page to be responsive to change of shape (1)
- have javascript/AJAX/JQuery

NOTES
- had to change css in base to have django variable part in head of html
	instead of in seperate css doc
	
TIPS
- CSS won't update? Try clearing the cache: shift + refresh page
